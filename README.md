# Weather-Warning
## Description
In this project I am in the works of building a weather application. You will be able to put in any city and see the weather for the next 5 days. Type in any city name and it will give you the weather, max tempature, the humidity and the wind speed for the day! It will also give your search history too. Plans for the future, I am currently working on making the buttons for the history work. However This is a fully functioning weather app for 5 days so you can know the weather in any area in the USA!
