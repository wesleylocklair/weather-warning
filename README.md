# Weather-Warning
## Description
In this project I am in the works of building a weather application. You will be able to put in any city and see the weather for the next 5 days. As of rightnow only the current weather in Charlotte NC is logged in the console when you press submit. I have not figured out how to use the input box html element to replace the location in the url. Going to mess with it more in the future.
